<h1>Best Raspberry Pi 4 Projects</h1>
<p>Bulid a New Computer<br>

<h2>Bulid a New Computer&#128187;</h2>
    <p id=rpipc>Old models of the Raspberry Pi are relatively powerful, but not powerful enough to build a reliable computer. Thanks to the Pi 4‚Äôs upgraded RAM and CPU (not to mention its dual-display capabilities), building a Pi-based desktop, laptop, or tablet is easier than ever.

Here are some Pi 4 computer projects that might appeal to you:

Desktop: The Raspberry Pi 4‚Äôs impressive RAM and CPU specs make it a great candidate for desktop use (whether you need a Linux or Windows PC). Grab an official Pi 4 Desktop Kit and go to town! And don‚Äôt forget the Pi 4 supports dual external displays.
Laptop: The Pi‚Äôs tiny form factor translates well to small PCs and, especially, laptops. We suggest you work with the Pi-Top laptop kits (they‚Äôre simple and cheap). The Pi Foundation also has its own list of laptop kits. Just make sure the kit you choose works with the Pi 4 before you buy it.
Tablet: There aren‚Äôt any Pi 4 tablet kits yet, but you can attach your Pi to the back of an official or unofficial touch screen monitor with some Velcro (now might be a good time to buy a Pi 4 case, too). This might sound ridiculous, but it‚Äôs a neat way to take your Pi on the go.
Of course, a Pi PC is no match for an average desktop computer. If you‚Äôve already got your fix on desktops, laptops, and tablets, it might be time to focus on a different Pi project.</p>
<h3>Enjoy Pi-based Gaming and Streaming&#127918;</h3>
<p>It seems like everyone has a Pi connected to their TV these days, and for a good reason. The Raspberry Pi is arguably better (and cheaper) than most streaming sticks and game consoles, and software like RetroPie and Kodi are easy to set up.

The Pi 4‚Äôs upgraded RAM and CPU make it an ideal candidate for hiccup-free home entertainment projects. So, without further ado, here are some great gaming and streaming Pi projects:

RetroPie: The RetroPie OS is easy to install, and it can turn your Pi 4 into an emulation station, a Kodi media player, or a miniature arcade machine. Note: At the time of writing, an easy installer isn‚Äôt yet available for the Pi4, but it‚Äôs coming.
Plex Media Server: A Pi is a cheap alternative to a PC or NVIDIA Shield Plex server. Just configure your Pi 4 with Plex, and you‚Äôre good to go.
Kodi Media Center: This is another cheap alternative for local streaming. Just configure your Pi 4 with Kodi and hit the ground running.
Raspicast: As odd as it sounds, you can use a Raspberry Pi instead of a Chromecast. Just set up your Pi, connect it to a TV, and launch the Raspicast app on your Android phone.
Most of these projects are easy to expand. Want to build an arcade machine? Do it with the RetroPie software! Want to turn your bedroom TV into a streaming machine? Attach a Pi to it!</p>
<h4>Expand Your Smarthomeüè†</h4>
<p>Smarthome devices are expensive, and they don‚Äôt always work as well as you‚Äôd expect. Plus, they‚Äôre impossible to service and can be out of date after just a few years. The solution? Build your own smarthome devices!

These projects are relatively hard (and require a bit of research), but they‚Äôre worth the effort. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Add Alexa to Your Pi: If you‚Äôre interested in building your own Alexa smart assistant, you‚Äôre in luck! Amazon has an official guide for Alexa on Raspberry Pi.
Smart Display: Why buy a smart display when you can build one? Simply choose a smarthome software (or use Alexa) and grab a small touch screen display.
Smart Mirror: After building a smart display, you might be inclined to create something more complicated and original. Why not build your own Pi-based smart mirror?
Home Security: In need of some Pi-based home security? Maybe it‚Äôs time to build a Pi security camera or configure a PrivateEyePi home alarm system.
Automated Home Gardening: Don‚Äôt you wish plants would just water themselves? Well, if you set up a smart gardening system, they can! You can follow a guide and build an automated gardening system or buy a premade one from SwitchDoc.
Again, the Pi 4‚Äôs updated specs make it ideal for smarthome builds (as opposed to older Pi models, that run at slower speeds). Just keep in mind most of these smarthome projects require some extra purchases, like Arduino boards, digital cameras, or touch screen displays.
